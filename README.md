# Monads for dummies

This code is the code used in my [blog post about monads](http://jabberwocky.eu/2012/11/02/monads-for-dummies/), with tests added.
To run the tests:
for javascript part:

    cd js
    vows

for clojure part:

    cd clojure
    lein test

This is obviously toy code, but the idea is to show how monads work.
Feedback welcome!
